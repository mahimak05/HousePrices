# HousePrices

House Price Prediction using Data Science!

In this project, we will use Jupyter Notebook and Python to predict house prices given a data set. Our independent values are area in square meters, rooms in the house, and age of the house. Our dependent value is the cost of the house, which can be predicted using Linear Regression in the panda library. We will import a csv file from an excel sheet to use the data as our independent and dependent variables. 

This project is simply used for practice. I give all credit to Yazılım Teknolojileri Akademisi, on Udemy who has uploaded all practice on his course: https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-with-python-course/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=msYS1Nvjv4c&ranSiteID=msYS1Nvjv4c-9Us.oBks7rBCqti8pis4Pw&LSNPUBID=msYS1Nvjv4c&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads.
